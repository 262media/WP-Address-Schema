 A simple plugin for displaying correctly formatted address information, as per the standards set out by http://schema.org/LocalBusiness.

== Description ==

WP Address Schema is a free plugin to allow you to quickly create correctly formatted address information to display on the front end of your Wordpress site. This formatting, as documented on the http://schema.org website, is used by major search providers such as Bing, Google, Yahoo! and Yandex to improve the display of search results.

WP Address Schema will continue to develop, but currently includes the following fields;
* Company Name
* Address Line 1
* Address Line 2
* Address Line 3
* Town/City
* State/County
* Country
* Postal/Zip Code
* Telephone
* Fax
* Opening Hours
